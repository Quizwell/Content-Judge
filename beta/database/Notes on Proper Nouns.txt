People Groups are a Group (Galileans, Gentiles)
Singular people group members are Names (Levite, Galilean, Pharisee)

I, I'll, I'm, and I've are Proper Nouns

DIFFERING FROM THE SCRIPTURE PORTION
Multi-word nouns are treated as a single word
E.G. "Holy Spirit" is a single Name, not two seperate Proper Nouns
