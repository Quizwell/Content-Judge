								"The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of people, who suppress the truth by their wickedness, ",
								"since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them. ",
								"For since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities - his eternal power and divine nature - have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse. ",
								"For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened. ",
								"Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools ",
								"and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like a mortal human being and birds and animals and reptiles. ",
								"Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another. ",
								"They exchanged the truth about God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator - who is forever praised. Amen.",
								"Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. ",
								"In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.",
								"Furthermore, just as they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, so God gave them over to a depraved mind, so that they do what ought not to be done. ",
								"They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice. They are gossips, ",
								"slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents; ",
								"they have no understanding, no fidelity, no love, no mercy. ",

								"God “will repay each person according to what they have done.”[a] ",
								"To those who by persistence in doing good seek glory, honor and immortality, he will give eternal life. ",
								"But for those who are self-seeking and who reject the truth and follow evil, there will be wrath and anger. ",
								"There will be trouble and distress for every human being who does evil: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile; ",

								"For God does not show favoritism. ",
								"All who sin apart from the law will also perish apart from the law, and all who sin under the law will be judged by the law. ",

								"(Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature things required by the law, they are a law for themselves, even though they do not have the law. ",
								"They show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts sometimes accusing them and at other times even defending them.) ",

								"Now to the one who works, wages are not credited as a gift but as an obligation. ",
								"However, to the one who does not work but trusts God who justifies the ungodly, their faith is credited as righteousness. ",

								"“Blessed are those whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered. ",
								"Blessed is the one whose sin the Lord will never count against them.”[b] ",
								"Is this blessedness only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? We have been saying that Abraham’s faith was credited to him as righteousness. ",
								"Under what circumstances was it credited? Was it after he was circumcised, or before? It was not after, but before! ",
								"And he received circumcision as a sign, a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. So then, he is the father of all who believe but have not been circumcised, in order that righteousness might be credited to them. ",
								"And he is then also the father of the circumcised who not only are circumcised but who also follow in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised. ",
								"It was not through the law that Abraham and his offspring received the promise that he would be heir of the world, but through the righteousness that comes by faith. ",
								"For if those who depend on the law are heirs, faith means nothing and the promise is worthless, ",
								"because the law brings wrath. And where there is no law there is no transgression. ",
								"Therefore, the promise comes by faith, so that it may be by grace and may be guaranteed to all Abraham’s offspring - not only to those who are of the law but also to those who have the faith of Abraham. He is the father of us all. ",
								"As it is written: “I have made you a father of many nations.”[c] He is our father in the sight of God, in whom he believed - the God who gives life to the dead and calls into being things that were not. ",

								"Yet he did not waver through unbelief regarding the promise of God, but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God, ",
